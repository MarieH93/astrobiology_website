        A planetary body that is capable of hosting life is habitable.
        So how does NASA define a habitability?
        <br>
        <br>
        According to NASA, a planet or moon that can support life must at least have
        <br>
        <i> "extended regions of liquid water, conditions favorable for the assembly
        of complex organic molecules, and energy sources to sustain metabolism" </i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Or course, in order to fulfil these minimum requirements, the planetary
        body in question must be at a reasonable distance from the nearest star.
        Not too close - in which case the surface would be too hot - and not too
        far away - making it too freezing; in short, the temperature and thus the
        distance to the corresponding star must be <i> just right</i>.
        Does this sound weirdly familiar and bring you back to your childhood
        and a certain stories about three bears and a Shirley-Temple-esque heroine
        with very refined tastes? Well it certainly did remind scientists of little
        Goldilocks and they subsequently dubbed the habitable zone in a stars orbit
        in which liquid water could exist the "Goldilocks Zone".
        <br>
        <br>
        Alright. Now let's assume we have such a planet, which, like the Earth or
        Mars, is at <i> just the right temperature</i>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next reasonable step is to look for water, of course. But why?
        Well, let's take a look at the system we know most about. Our own Earth.
        Water is abundant. And one striking insight is that whenever you find water -
        with the gratifying exception of bottled water - chance are you will also
        life. This doesn't only hold true for moderately tempered water but also
        for steaming hot water erupting from the surface driven by volcanic activity
        or ice on the poles. There is a fantastic article
        <a href="https://www.livescience.com/52332-why-is-water-needed-for-life.html">here</a>,
        which gives you a thorough idea of the importance of water.
        <br>
        <br>
        So ... is there water on Mars? Well, this is one of the questions the <a href="">Mars rovers</a>
        are trying to find out.
        <br>
        But what kind of organisms would be capable of surviving the rough conditions
        on a planet so far away from the one they evolved on?
        <br>
        There are a couple of forces to be reckoned with on our planet itself whose
        evolutionary history predispose them for the life on the edge.
        There are bacteria braving boiling waters, by protecting themselves with
        elaborate biological precautions. All sorts of creatures have adapted their
        physiology to the conditions in the deep sea, a place with excessive pressure,
        a distinct lack of sunlight and extremely low oxygen levels - describing
        all their adaptations would warrant an article on its own.
        Many of you may have heard of the world's toughest bear - albeit tiny, the
        microscopic tardigrade has a clever strategy: If conditions become unfavourable
        (and I mean really unfavourable), it turns into its extreme hibernation shape,
        switches off its metabolism and thus manages to withstand temperatures close
        absolute zero, the vacuum of space, a century of drought and even extreme radiation.
        But even this is nothing. The site of 1986's nuclear catastrophe, Chernobyl,
        hosts masses of incredible black fungal colonies which not only survive the huge
        amounts of radiation, but <i>feed on it</i>.
        <br>
        You can see ... life is tough. As long as a planetary body offers the minimum requirements
        for life, you can assume that we would manage to get life to establish there.

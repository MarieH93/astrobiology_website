        Let's face it. Mars has always fascinated us.
        <br>
        <br>
        It took some serious technological advancements to seriously consider a visit to Mars, though.
        <br>
        Since the launch of the first attempted mission to fly by Mars in 1960
        by the Soviet Union, there has been a multitude of further mission to
        explore the red planet. While many of these missions failed, there
        have by now been many successful steps to further our knowledge.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Notably, the first human product to land on Mars, the Mars 3 lander in 1971, sadly
        lost contact to Earth only seconds after it landed and started to transmit. Also
        in 1971, the first fully successful orbiter, Mariner 9, was deactivated after an
        astonishing 516 days in Mars' orbit.
        <br>
        The first solid data transmission from the surface of Mars was brought to us
        by the Viking 1 lander in 1975. This gave us the <i> very first clear image </i>
        from the surface of the red planet - albeit in black & white.

        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, 19 missions have successfully explored Mars and 8 exploratory sondes are still operational.
        <br>
        <br>
        Of course, the most beloved of these are the famous Mars rovers, sturdy looking vehicles that
        fearlessly explore the territory, sending home sme truly otherworldly imagery:

        But what kind of organisms would be capable of surviving the rough conditions
        on a planet so far away from the one they evolved on?
        <br>
        There are a couple of forces to be reckoned with on our planet itself whose
        evolutionary history predispose them for the life on the edge.
        There are bacteria braving boiling waters, by protecting themselves with
        elaborate biological precautions. All sorts of creatures have adapted their
        physiology to the conditions in the deep sea, a place with excessive pressure,
        a distinct lack of sunlight and extremely low oxygen levels - describing
        all their adaptations would warrant an article on its own.
        Many of you may have heard of the world's toughest bear - albeit tiny, the
        microscopic tardigrade has a clever strategy: If conditions become unfavourable
        (and I mean really unfavourable), it turns into its extreme hibernation shape,
        switches off its metabolism and thus manages to withstand temperatures close
        absolute zero, the vacuum of space, a century of drought and even extreme radiation.
        But even this is nothing. The site of 1986's nuclear catastrophe, Chernobyl,
        hosts masses of incredible black fungal colonies which not only survive the huge
        amounts of radiation, but <i>feed on it</i>.
        <br>
        You can see ... life is tough. As long as a planetary body offers the minimum requirements
        for life, you can assume that we would manage to get life to establish there.
